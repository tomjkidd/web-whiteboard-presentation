Agenda for this meeting:

Title: `web-whiteboard`: a review of my first full clojure project

Speaker: Tom Kidd

Abstract : `web-whiteboard` is a project that I created to exercise all of the Clojure concepts I had learned during my first 9 months of using the language.

With the goal of being able to share a whiteboard over the internet with friends, I used ClojureScript to create a client and Clojure to create a server. In the spirit of a show-and-tell, we'll look at how I approached the design and implementation of the system and talk about what I learned from the experience.
